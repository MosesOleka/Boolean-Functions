#Question 1 write a function that returns a bool type

x = True
print(type(x))

a= 40
b= 136

print(bool(a==b)) #returns false as a is not equal to b
print(bool(a>b))  #returns false as a is not greater than b
print(bool(a<b))  #returns true as a is greater than b
print(bool(a!=b))  #returns true as a is not equal to b
